          <h3>Overall Conclusion:</h3>
          <p>
            After all our model tests had been completed, we discovered that the muliple linear regressions did not perform as well as we wanted. After further evaluation, we determined that out of all tests run, the three best results were from our 5th, 6th, and 7th Neural Network tests, with R^2 scores of 56.535%, 58.178%, 59.190% respectively. 
          </p>
          
          <h3>Improvements:</h3>
          
          <p>
            As we progressed through our testing, there were several minor problems that we encountered: There could have been some extraneous outliers that messed with our data, a new tuner would have been better, or the data set was just an overal bad fit. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Our data set may have not been a good fit to use for a multiple linear regression test. 
          </p>
          <p>
            2. A different tuner could have been implemented if there had been more time for us to work with the Keras Tuner to have gotten a more conclusive result.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Even with the ETL process, there were still several data "shenanigans" that could have skewed the entire data, e.g., a 0.5mm shell length.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Overall Thoughts:</h3>
          <p>
            While we did not accomplish what we had set out to accomplish, the process of utilizing machine learning to try and make a positive, real-life impact on the world, even something as small and niche as abalone shells, was informative and helped us incorporate and apply the skills
            we have learned in this course.
